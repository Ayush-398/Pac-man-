# Pac-man

This project presents a modern implementation of the classic arcade game PACMAN, developed using the C programming language and the Raylib library for the graphical interface. The objective is to recreate the iconic PACMAN gameplay, where players navigate a maze, collect pellets, avoid ghosts, and aim to achieve high scores. The project leverages the efficiency and control provided by C for game logic and the simplicity and power of Raylib for rendering graphics and handling user input responsive controls, all designed to deliver an engaging and nostalgic gaming experience. This project serves as both a tribute to a timeless classic and a practical exercise in game development using contemporary programming tools.
